This repository is created to support the article 'Mapping the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands' published on Medium.

Two Jupyter notebooks titled plotting_geopandas.ipynb and plotting_folium.ipynb show workflows for plotting geospatial data using Geopandas and Folium libraries, respectively. The data are imported from the following source: https://nlcovid-19-esrinl-content.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/covid-19-actuele-gegevens-rivm-vlakken. File COVID-19_Actuele_gegevens_RIVM_(vlakken).csv contains the geospatial data which was downloaded on the 4th May 2020.
